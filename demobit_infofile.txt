this is a bit hard to get running on new machine

you need:
* nodejs
* jeskola buzz
* a modern browser (firefox or chrome)
* loopmidi

after you install all that you run `npm install` to install the nodejs project dependencies

and launch it with `npm start`

then you need to get loopmidi working with buzz and each of the midi channels the performance uses available on buzz.

map them all to the correct parameters (names from app.js should be self explanatory)

and press play on buzz

then check your ip, launch the webbrowser and load <yourip>:70/canvas, put it in fullscreen

people in the network can control parameters by accessing <yourip>:70

on the main canvas arrow keys control effect transition, space and backspace control text transition

there are also hotkeys 1234567890qwer to toggle on and off layers
